# 10 Facts About This Huge Surprise I had earlier today💖

Should've been a _surprise_,
but I was TOO excited and uploaded a ton of stories about it.
I should have told you about the 7th one.

1. Not sure when it first came up to mind,
   but the Notion database dates back to 17th December.
   I had only two weeks left to spare, so the final product looks a bit rushed.
2. Everyone thought it was built with a next-gen island architecture framework made for faster websites
   [Astro](https://astro.build/) integrated with a content management system
   [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/)

   > In fact, it was made with love and care for all of you.💖

3. In all seriousness, the website itself was actually built with Astro and Notion;
   however, copying and sending 200+ links from the database could not have been possible without
   purposefully making a LINE bot to retrieve all those links from the database and sent them to my phone.

4. And, this will also be another fun fact: I wrote everyone's name in Thai no matter what.
   If I had sent the links to the wrong people, they wouldn't know about it.😝
5. Yes, I did send one link to the wrong person. Yes, now they know I just wrote the same thing. Yes, it was embarassing.
6. And if you wonder,

   > What's the point of the 6-digit code after my name?

   Imagine you know how the URL is structured, you would be able to just
   type anyone's name in the address. Well, you can't because you don't know
   their 6-digit code. I am cybersecurity-trained.

7. But not you! What if I sent a malicious link to all of you?
   I could've just phish your passwords and private information.
   I sincerely apologize for not clarifying what I just sent, because there are A LOT of people to send to.

   For example, an IP address. Technically, I could just grab any visitor's by using `Astro.clientAddress`.
   Well, your IP address is always exposed to the outer world while surfing the internet.
   It does tell your location, but at most a rough guess, such as `Tokyo, Japan`.

   However, please be careful not to enter any passwords or private information in any untrustworthy websites.

8. One of the reasons why I purposefully made a website is the ability to use **Components**.
   Components are reusuable website resources, meaning I could make a template then efficiently write personal messages around that.
   I wouldn't have been able to write 200 letters by hand!
9. However, that sure had caused a handful of problems. The website crashed in production, because I forgot to `import` the component before using it.
10. There are, and will be yet many letters left unread.💔 But my job there is done.
