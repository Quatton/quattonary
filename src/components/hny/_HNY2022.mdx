# 2022 has been a tough year for me. But I have been a tough year for 2022.

Choose your language at the top. I _cannot_ control the content to be the same due to my different level of proficiency in each of them.
English probably has the most (sentimental ;-;) content out there, because writing in Thai sometimes cringed me out
so I omitted some parts. Enjoy!

**_It's long. Very long!_**

## A message to you

Okay, before talking about myself. Let's talk about you!
YES. YOU. ALL. This message will be sent to everyone, including whom I do not even know.
But it is for you!

First, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I forgot most of your birthdays, for one (or more) of the following reasons:

1.  I have been trying to find new photos of us to post with the wish but I TOOK WITH NO ONE THIS YEAR.
2.  I thought we already went separate way and it was a little bit too shy and awkward.
3.  Genuinely forgot or I don't know when your birthday is. (Tell me!)

## You might need this

This year might be a terrible year for you as well. You have been going through ups-and-downs.
You might have lost someone or something important to you.
You might missed out an opportunity that will never come back.
You might regret what you did wrong.

I always think that every single decision of my life has made me me today,
and I always strategically chose THE BEST decision **_as far as I know_**.
Things might go bad. Well, I didn't know! If I knew, I'd not intentionally choose the worse choice, right?
I was not randomizing over possibilities
but I weighed it out and chose the most advantageous option!

So, you did well!
If a perfect turing machine were to compute your best decision
based on your knowledge, it would probably need infinite time,
but you did it _way_ more efficiently.
Wow, that means you are so amazing. Great job!
Remember, [a turing machine does not even know whether a certain program will halt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem).
You are not meant to solve everything in your life.

## From 00:00 in my timezone

or if you're in Thailand, in your timezone
I'll be distributing my special messages to all of you!

Well, for now. What a year, right? Hope you enjoy it. See ya!
