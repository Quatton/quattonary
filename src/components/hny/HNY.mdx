# 2022 has been a tough year for me. But I have been a tough year for 2022.

Choose your language at the top. I _cannot_ control the content to be the same due to my proficiency in each of them. English probably has the most (sentimental ;-;) content out there, because writing in Thai sometimes cringed me out so I omitted some parts. Enjoy!

**_It's long. Very long! (10-15 minutes read, depending on your special message)_**

## A message to you

Okay, before talking about myself. Let's talk about you!
YES. YOU. ALL. This message will be sent to everyone, including whom I do not even know.
But it is for you!

First, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I forgot most of your birthdays, for one (or more) of the following reasons:

1.  I have been trying to find new photos of us to post with the wish but I TOOK WITH NO ONE THIS YEAR.
2.  I thought we already went separate way and I was a little bit too shy and awkward.
3.  Genuinely forgot or I don't know when your birthday is. (Tell me!)

## You might need this

This year might be a terrible year for you as well. You have been going through ups-and-downs.
You might have lost someone or something important to you.
You might missed out an opportunity that will never come back.
You might regret what you did wrong.

I always think that every single decision of my life has made me me today,
and I always strategically chose THE BEST decision **_as far as I know_**.
Things might go bad. Well, I didn't know! If I knew, I'd not intentionally choose the worse choice, right?
I was not randomizing over possibilities
but I weighed it out and chose the most advantageous option!

So, you did well! You were right all the time if a perfect turing machine computed your best decision based on your knowledge. It would probably need infinite time, but you did it _way_ more efficiently. Wow, that means you are so amazing. Great job!
Remember, [a turing machine does not even know whether a certain program will halt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem). You are not mean to solve everything in your life.

## Thank you for being with me

I believe that I have always been public about my mental health.
It had striked me several times, and it made me **_not me_** during the entire year.

No matter would it be "Just-leave-me-alone January" or "Might-be-a-depression May" or "No-way-therapy-is-so-expensive November", you all stayed there for me, and I appreciate that.
Yes, I might have suddenly been out of character, become clingy and annoying, or conversely ignored all your messages. Weird, right?

You were there. Therefore I am today. Thank you!

## Let's start again

I was HONESTLY very bad and juggling relationships with people. Either I cared about you too much, or not at all. Either I talked non-stop, or let no word come out of my mouth. Nevertheless, either of these extremes means "Hey. You are very cool. I love you. However, I don't really know how to approach you. Please accept my friend request."

At this point of my life, I don't specifically hate anyone. I can confirm. I might have had, but definitely not now when I am a grown-up. Well, I could be avoiding you, but because of the opposite: I don't think you really like me...?

If you COULD read this. That means I 100% care about you. No matter if you got this link from my Instagram, a group chat or whatever, I do care about you, alright. Listen. It is quite ironic to justify this, but it was not really arrogance or hatred or any negativity. I was literally speechless when I looked at you and _"wtf do i do. mom, come get me."_ So if you are happy to maintain/make our friendship. Let's do it!

Or you might do not even know me. I send this to literally everyone.

## OH WAIT. You've got a code??

What? Show me! I also want to see if it works, haha.
