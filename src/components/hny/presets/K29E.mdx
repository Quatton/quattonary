Happy New Year.

I was trying to make this look just like the traditional 年賀状, with top-down writing style and decorations revolving around rabbits. However, I also had to make it compatible with every screen size, extensive length of texts, and possible infiltration of English. Let's settle this and blame it on my miserable CSS skill. You gotta love this newly adopted unorthodox New Year's card from the western world.

It was a miracle to spend my first year in Japan with you all in 29 組.
Even though my Japanese is as old as the time I have lived here, you all made me feel belonged as one of you, as if we were speaking the same languages (not really I knew). We collaborated in several class 企画 and thank you for trusting me and letting me take responsibility for a large part of it.

Although I admit I was quite confident with my academic abilities, especially English and Informatics in the last semester, I was not confident enough to be a シケ対; that would've been the next level. It might be useless to talk about it now since we have made it through, but you could always reach me any time. I can't guarantee I could give the correct answer, though. I don't even know what the prof's been talking about. Let's talk nonetheless.

Due to my genuinely limited Japanese and a lack of knowledge in Japanese culture, I was very quiet and tried not to make any conflicts whatsoever. I was so afraid I'm gonna break any 'unwritten rules' if I were not aware of it. Therefore, my social interaction circle was very small compared to how much I wanted to get to know you all. Next year, I'm not gonna care as hard as before, but be sure to write any unwritten rules for me. If I happened to cause misunderstanding or conflicts I wasn't aware of in the past year, I was not trying to start a war. I was just dumb, alright?

I'm looking forward to see you in the next year. Let's try our best in the final exam, especially German. I don't usually hate German, but studying a fourth language with my undeveloped third is undoubtedly painful. Imagine you have to learn German in Korean you studied for one year. Thank you for your support that has made me progress this far.
