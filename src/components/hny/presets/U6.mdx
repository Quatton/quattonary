I don’t know what was wrong with me mid-year, but I am completely doing fine here! I know there are a lot of changes, so it was quite understandable to get stressed out a bit here and there. It might be a tough year for you as well due to the same reasons, so I am glad we were able to get through it and here we are, at least standing alive and well.

It was a memorable experience with you all in the U6.
If I went straight to the university without having a prep school with y’all, I’d die.
Well indeed figuratively, but literally could also be possible.
You have made my 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, and I will never forget it.
At first I thought I just missed having Japanese in the morning
and high-school science and math in the afternoon.
True, that's always been my dream, but maybe I am just missing you.
It wasn’t always easy to make new friends with
Japanese people whereas just sitting next to y'all
made us friends for life in a matter of seconds.
