I want to send a letter to my crush, please help brush up the structure, paraphrase with better terms and translate to Japanese:

"That day, I told you I needed to look at the 新入生の自己紹介 to realize you love robots. To be honest, I lied. I instantly picked the robot seminar without a second thought, then went to confirm with you. I had no backup plan, and I also couldn't afford to say I actually remembered that. That would be a bit suspicious... I'm glad you were still impressed by that.

I love how much you're passionate about what you're doing, and that's what I've been looking up to. I myself entered the University of Tokyo by such a simple mean: writing an essay about natural language processing, without ever touching it once, then memorizing everything to the interview. Although I passed, I don't feel qualified. I have never had "real" experiences, for example, a research project, competitive programming, or even any software with a bigger scale than a to-do list. I didn't know much about you back then, but then I started googling about it. I felt bad invading your privacy; I didn't know what to do, so I admitted it out of guilt. I'm glad you were fine with it. I was so scared.

Since then, I have been looking up to you as a role model. I wanted to be inspired by you, so I started trying to get attention from you stubbornly EVERY SINGLE DAY. One day I saw you up on Discord at late night, so I tried to live a nocturnal life like you, listen to every music you play, and even tried convincing you to get Spotify Premium for a week. (相変わらず, I admitted that I had been listening to you and asked if it notified. I didn't want to invade your privacy without your consent haha.) Until one day, I realized you were already annoyed and that I could listen along even if you didn't have a premium subscription.

I just wanted to let you know that although I am not interested in the same field as you, I have been greatly inspired by your passion in robotics. I had been honing my skills and had the opportunity to participate in a small software project over the summer break, which was a lot of fun. It always reminded me of you. I have always been interested in your サークル, but we have too little in common. Currently, I am doing CTF, and mostly anythinh about security. If you're interested (the same way I am interested in yours), I am happy to let you know about it!

All these two years in the university felt useless when we already have a 内定, so I have been losing out my passion for Computer Science every time I hold the 安全ピペッター. I thought you were going to feel the same but then I looked at you. You have been keeping both school work and サークル in parallel. I am honestly impressed and inspired at the same time. Thank you for letting me ask for your attention every single week. I would have given up without you.

I love being your friend.
