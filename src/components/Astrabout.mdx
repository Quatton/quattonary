## What do I do here?

Hello! I am Quatton, and this is **Quattonary**. I am a computer science student graduating in 2026. I am planning on fun-sized articles and small frontend projects built with various frontend frameworks. Like a [Diorama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorama) in the world of software!

I have been working on web development for 3 years, but I have never committed to making **_one serious project_**. Well, until today! I am making something I should have been working on for a long time: a portfolio.
