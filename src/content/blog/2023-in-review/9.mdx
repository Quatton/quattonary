## But there's still a lot of work to do

Although the way we train, test, evaluate models is based on research and best practices, it is still the best practice _as of now_.

If you keep up with the latest research, you'll find new papers like [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)
on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) which claims you don't need to build a reward model specifically for Reinforcement Learning;
it's secretly lies under the model itself!
