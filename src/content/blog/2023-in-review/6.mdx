## Caveats

The core idea of a framework is important, but sometimes it can be frustrating when you switch to a framework with a smaller community
and they couldn't cover every bug, edge case, or feature request fast enough.

You can say **React** is bad however you want, but it's going to be just like **jQuery**. It's here to stay.

Pick a framework large enough, that you don't feel dreaded writing the codes. Period.
