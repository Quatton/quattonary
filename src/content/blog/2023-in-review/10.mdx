## But wait, there's more!

And [more papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12036) down the line, we found that **DPO** is a merely special case of its generalized counterpart, **ΨPO**,
and there're some pitfalls that made **DPO** prone to overfitting. Now you can make the optimization even less arbirary by finding a form of **Ψ**, here the research picked **Identity** (e.g. return the input as it is).

Just when we thought a method is perfect, we found a new evidence that results in a new method, and the cycle continues.
