## So there's no best framework?

Ultimately, you need to understand the core idea of how **React** re-renders, how **Svelte** compiles, or even how **Vue** updates the VDOM differenly from **React**.
If a framework doesn't trigger re-render like **React**, how would you implement an `onChange` animation?

Then you can make your own decision on do I switch to another framework or how do I optimize my code to follow its best practice.
