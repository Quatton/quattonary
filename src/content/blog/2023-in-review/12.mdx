## What will I work on in 2024?

I have never touched payment before in 2023, therefore I have never sold anything in my software.
This year I will make my first sale, and try to build an open-source project around simplifying payment for developers.

I want to contribute to the AI/ML world more, especially in the area of connecting AI to Web Development (e.g. MLOps)

I will also put more focus on my study at the university, and try to grasp the low-level fundamentals of computer science,
while also maintaining good grades as a bonus.
