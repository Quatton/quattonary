## They're built different

> The two solve different problems in different steps in React. Forget may do well if your data changes infrequently. Million.js may work better if you have a lot of "hot" data and require a lot of rerenders.

We could say the same about different frameworks. They solve different problems or remove a certain problem entirely (e.g. no re-render so don't have to deal with reconcilation).
