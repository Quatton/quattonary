## The best framework is...

I have been an avid user of **Next.js**, but this year I spent time expanding my horizon to learn **Flutter**, **Svelte(Kit)**, **Vue** & **Nuxt.js**, **Solid**, and **React Native**.

When you move from **React** to **Vue**, you'll find that "Wow. **React** really sucks. Look at how **Vue** handles _XYZ_".
The same applies to when you move from **Vue** to **Svelte**, to **Solid**, and so on. You'll find that each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses.
