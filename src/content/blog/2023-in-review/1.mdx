## A little bit about this blog

Because this is the first blog I've ever written on my personal website, you might feel surprised about the format in which I've written it.
This book is written with pure static-site generator, and therefore, without JavaScript.

I know! It's unbelievable. CSS today is powerful but by no means perfect, so if you scroll to the right you will see this page literally mirrored. But it's good enough for me.
