## AI. AI. Generative AI. AI.

Yeah it's kind of a big thing in 2023. I have worked with AI on 4 of my projects.

To be honest, there is nothing wrong with the AI hype.

It's just that AI is not a magic wand. Especially deep learning and neural networks, they are built to solve a specific task where you don't know how
to solve it with closed-form solutions or algorithms.
