## 2023 was AMAZING

I cannot stressed how much my dev career has grown since January.
I have learned so much while also nailing tons and tons of accomplishments, earning my first internet dollars, and getting my first job as a developer.

Honestly the world is moving so fast with the help of Generative AI and rapid development of Open-Source projects, I feel like the opportunity came at the right time for me.
