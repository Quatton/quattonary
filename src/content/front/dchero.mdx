# DCHero

I never once in my life thought I would touch Web-3 related technology.
But here I am, blindly trying to create a credential verification system using
Solitidy and Next.js.

This project is a submission for the [Builders Weekend Hackathon 2023](https://www.buildersweekend.co/)
We had a sponsor from [Astar](https://astar.network/) which at the end awarded us 10000 JPY as a winner of the track.

## What I learned?

### Web 3 -- from the ground up

I have never touched Web 3 before, so I had to learn everything from the ground up.
I wrote my first smart contract in Solidity, and deployed it to the testnet.

I also learned how to use [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh) to work with Ethereum on React. It was really surprising how full-fletched the library is despite being so new.
It's based on React Query, so I really appreciate their technical choices. üëç‚ú®
The type definitions are also very good and easy to configure.

But most importantly, for the first time in my life, I wrote a backend in Solidity.
Basically it's merely a class definition with a few functions, but the confusing part is deploying it on chain.

The blockchain made it so difficult to work on "a dev server" (since there's no "server" in the first place).
I had to deploy the contract to the testnet, pay some fee, get the contract address, and then generate ABI and address to use in the frontend.

Yeah... probably not going to do this again. Will stick to the good old Web 2 for now.

### Networking

As in networking with people, not with computers.

Builders Weekend is a hackathon that I joined alone. I had to go through tables and form a team with strangers.
This is the complete opposite of [Refoodable](/refoodable), where I worked with my friends from the same high school.
It was not easy, but I managed to find a team of 3 people, and we worked together for 2 days without knowing each other's work style, specialties, and interests.

I believe I did a good job at communicating with my team members, and we managed to finish the project on time.
One member of the team happened to be a student of the same year at the same university as me, so that was a nice surprise.

I did manage to get a handful of LinkedIn connections, so I guess that's a plus.
