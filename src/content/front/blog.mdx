# Blog

In 2024, I plan to write more blogs, mainly about my research or side projects I am working on.
I will also write about my experience in the software industry and share my thoughts on the latest technologies.

Twitter (Currently known as X) is a bit too short and lacks fancy formatting so I will use this place to write longer posts.
I'll keep myself accountable by writing at least one blog post biweekly.

Enjoy!
