# ReFoodable

Refoodable is a flutter app that connects store owners with customers to sell food that would otherwise be thrown away.
This project is submitted to the [GDSC Solution Challenge 2023](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge).
(The link will be updated to current year anyway)

I teamed up with <Person id="natprawee"/>, <Person id="supawich" />, and <Person id="tetus" /> to create this project.
We were all from the same high school, and we were relatively new to Flutter.

## Technologies

## What I learned

### Flutter State Management

The API is similar to React, with an additional `const` to mark a component as immutable. `const` in Dart was really weird, especially when you use it with class, but I got the hang of it.
At first it was really fun to optimize `StatelessWidget` part and `StatefulWidget` part.

Well, until I noticed how unmaintainable the code can be when you have to pass the "reference" of a state down the widget tree.
I used `Provider` before so I realized how much better `Riverpod` is. The API is much more intuitive, similar to that of Svelte's store, but with more features on `Future` and `Stream`.

To be honest, I have to admit I overly use it to the point where it was really hard to refactor, and generated a giant merge conflict during the last days of the challenge. Phew.

### Dart's Type Safety Is Really Good

We all know that Dart is a statically typed language, and as a TypeScript advocate, I volunteered to handle the data model.
`@freezed` decorator is for hanling serialization `fromJson` and `toJson` for you, among other constructors, `toString`, `copyWith`, and `==` operator.
At was I was skeptical because I was not a big fan of code generation, but it turned out to be _fine_ for me.

One thing I really really like about Dart is `extension`. Well, it's like TypeScript interface, but here you can add methods to existing classes. (!?)
Here I used it to parse Firebase type to add more type safety in both query and mutation.

````dart
extension FirestoreX on FirebaseFirestore {
  /// Get a reference to a stores collection
  /// which can be used to query the stores.
  ///
  /// Example:
  /// ```dart
  /// final storesRef = FirebaseFirestore.instance.stores;
  /// final snapshots = await storesRef.get();
  /// final stores = snapshots.docs.map((e) => e.data()).toList();
  /// ```
  CollectionReference<Store> get stores =>
      collection(ApiPath.stores).withConverter(
          fromFirestore: (snapshot, _) => Store.fromFirestore(snapshot),
          toFirestore: (store, _) => store.toFirestore());
}
````

Here I just added a `stores` getter to `FirebaseFirestore` class, which automatically attaches a converter to the collection reference.
It's **INSANE** how you could just use `FirebaseFirestore` normally with the extended method.

### Dealing with GitHub as a Team

Because for the past 3 years of software development, I was just yolo pushing to master. I was not use d to the concept of branching and pull request.
Well, branching & pull request itself is simple, but fixing merge conflict is _pain_.

You need to separate files into components, and each of the team member should work on different components.
Usually when a merge conflict happens, it is most likely that we can just use the latest version of the file.
However, what happened to us was not the case.

2 of us worked on the same story without knowing it, because one was working from mocking the UI and the other was working from the data fetching.
Now we had 2 files that were completely different. And guess what? The one who handled the merge conflict was a third person who was not involved in the story, which unknowingly deleted the duplicate code.
We had to reconcile the code manually, and it was a pain.

Yeah, I hate Jira.
