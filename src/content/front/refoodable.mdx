# ReFoodable

Refoodable is a flutter app that connects store owners with customers to sell food that would otherwise be thrown away.
This project is submitted to the [GDSC Solution Challenge 2023](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge).
(The link will be updated to current year anyway)

I teamed up with <Person id="natprawee"/>, <Person id="supawich" />, and <Person id="tetus" /> to create this project.
We were all from the same high school, and we were relatively new to Flutter.
