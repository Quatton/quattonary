# Creeks

It was the first project that I had a great framework to start with. This project was a submission to the [Buildspace S4](https://buildspace.so/) where I learned to iterate the project with the community.

Creeks will always have a special place in my heart. It was the first project that my mom really loves and uses. Sadly, I just abruptly discontinued it.

Creeks is a brainstorm board, a hybrid between voice and text. You can just keep your thoughts flow like a creek, and it will compile your thoughts into a readable format.
Moreever, you can also use Creeks to derive a Mermaid diagram from your thoughts.

## Technologies

- SvelteKit
  - TipTap
  - Skeleton UI
  - Mermaid
- OpenAI Whisper & GPT-3.5-Turbo
- Supabase

## What I learned

### Just keep iterating it.

Buildspace had thought me a simple framework to iterate on the project.

1. Define your audience
2. Build a toy
3. Get people to play with your toy and ask for feedback
4. Iterate on the feedback
5. Spread the word to more channels and repeat

It is intended to be aggressive, yet minimal, allowing you keep the mindset forever.
I love the Buildspace team and community. The event turned out very well, and I will surely join the next one.

### Building local-first app

Because I didn't use Supabase as a database, I intended to let users save their notes in the browser.
It was intuitive at first, because this is exactly how Firebase Realtime works: JSON everywhere. However, it's only when I tried to sync the notes from local to server, I realized that it's not that easy.

I decided to just not allow server -> local sync, and only allow local -> server sync. It's a bit of a bummer, but it's a good tradeoff for the sake of simplicity.
I also made it so that the shared notes have to be synced manually.

I wish I was more capable to make it more technically robust but well, it's been a great project after all.

### Hybrid voice recording

I believe I am one of the first people to build a hybrid voice recording app that syncs with text chronologically. I am very proud of this feature, because the implementation is not trivial.
Also, this also allows me to chunk up the voice recording into smaller pieces, which is very useful for parallel transcription by OpenAI Whisper.

One more thing is that the transcriptions are also transformed into mindmaps built on top of Mermaid. This is also a very cool feature that I am proud of. It also has features like branching and suggesting a thought-provoking question.

> my mom loves this feature because she doesn't have to type and can just draw her thoughts out into a mindmap

It has too much potential I couldn't just kill it. I will definitely come back to this project in the future and make it better.
