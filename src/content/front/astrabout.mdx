# About this website

## What do I do here?

Hello! I am Quatton, and this is **Quattonary**. I am a computer science student graduating in 2026.
This is my personal website, where I post my projects, blog posts, and other things I find interesting.

## Why Astro?

I have built this website using [Astro](https://astro.build/) since when it was congratulating its first 1.0 release.
And I have to say, it is FAST. It is really easy and loaded with blog-friendly features, and most importantly, I can just chuck in any UI framework I want.
It was really a good starting point when I wanted to learn every framework ever. (bad idea, I know)
