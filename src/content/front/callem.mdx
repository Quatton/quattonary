## Callem

Don't wanna make a call yourself? Clone your voice with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) and Call'em.

Callem was a submission made to [ElevenLabs AI Hackathon](https://lablab.ai/event/eleven-labs-ai-hackathon) and it has one of the most _interesting_ techstack I have ever used.
This project had a birght future ahead of it, because customer service via voice is still in demand and could've been made cheaper with more availability.

Unfortunately, I ran out of ElevenLabs credits and it was quite costly to make international phone calls so I had to discontinue it.

There are a few people who contacted me to talk about the project, to which I accidentally ghosted because I missed the meeting _TWICE_. Hey, Tony if you're reading this, I'm sorry.
Feel free to contact me again.

## Technology

- Bun
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/)
- Turso DB (SQLite) + DrizzleORM
- HTMX
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) API
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) GPT-3.5-Turbo

> Elysia? HTMX? For real? Hell yeah, I hosted it on [Fly.io](https://fly.io) and it was a blast. I'm really satisfied with the results.

Before getting to the reflection, I'd like to talk about my techstack choices. I wanted to try something unique, **really** unique.
I heard HTMX had been gaining traction and I wanted to try it out. I also wanted to try out Bun, a relatively (at the time) new JavaScript runtime, bundler, and package manager, so I guess Elysia would be one of the best choices.
It also had a built-in JWT, Type Validation, and Web Socket support, which was a huge plus.

## What did I learn?

### International Phone Calls are expensive

> Wait, so toll-free is not free?

The Twilio API was $20 over the 3 days of the hackathon; however, my phone call bill was $100. I was not expecting that.
Sooooo, make sure you know ins-and-outs of the technology you're using.

### Streaming Audio

ElevenLabs serves the audio in streams, which was a bit of a challenge to pipe that to TwiML. I tried to use WebSocket but it was really difficult to get it to work, mainly because the audio Twilio accepts in WebSocket is not what ElevenLabs serves.
The main issue was that most audio conversion libraries were not compatible with Bun. Unfortunately, I had to stick to the approach of just serving audio files.
First I downloaded the entire `.mp3` and then built a route handler to server a static file. It was a bit slow, so instead I ended up with returning the entire response stream I got from ElevenLabs.
Well, it worked, so I didn't dare to touch it.

### 502 Bad Gateway

One annoying thing about Fly.io is that it mysteriously returns 502 Bad Gateway. I'm not sure why, but it was really annoying.
Because it would happen to some but not all routes, sometimes the call would go through one layer, and then fail at another layer.

**THAT COSTED ME A LOT OF MONEY WHICH SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SPENT.**

Anyway, I still don't know why it happened, but my solution was to warm up the server by sending some Insomnia requests before making the actual call.
This is one of the reason why I discontinued the project. I should use a more stable technology.
